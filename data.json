It is difficult for me to say where I want to be exactly 5 years from now as this industry tends to change a lot, opening up new opportunities and creating new professions. But if I had to guess, I would say it would be somewhere in between or a mixture of Art Director and Creative Coder."

I hope to earn my living doing something that combines my talents and interests. I'm a decent enough developer and I've always enjoyed art (drawing and painting).
