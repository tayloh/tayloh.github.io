    <!-- An SVG file is an image format.
    Each "shape" is an object (a group object) 
    Each group has a path, strokesize, etc 
    Each shape is encoded as a path 
    Path, fill, and id 
    The effect of this is that the image is scaleable
    no matter how much you zoom in
    its never getting pixelated
    since it always renders the paths based on the size 
    (this is in contrast to a raster image which is made up of a grid of pixels)
    This is why its called Scaleable Vector Graphics (SVG)-->
